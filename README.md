# 🍔 Food Delivery App

A full-stack food delivery application inspired by platforms like **Swiggy / Zomato**, built with modern frontend architecture and scalable backend design.

This project focuses on **real-world system behavior** such as restaurant-based carts, dynamic menus, backend-driven cart persistence, and clean UI/UX.
